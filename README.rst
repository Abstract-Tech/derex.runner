Run Open edX docker images

Requirements
------------

Make sure you have python 3.6 or later and docker 19.03.5 or later installed.

A virtualenv is also recommended. For derex we use `direnv
<https://direnv.net/>`_. Its main purpose is to define directory-specific
environment variables, but it can also automatically activate a virtualenv when
you ```cd``` into a directory. We include a ```.envrc``` file that will instruct
```direnv``` to create and activate a local python3 virtualenv.

We recommend to `install it <https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html>`_ to try
out the following instructions. Alternatively you can replace ```direnv allow```
with your virtualenv activation command.


Quickstart
----------

Run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/Abstract-Tech/derex.runner.git
    cd derex.runner
    direnv allow
    pip install -r requirements.txt -e .
    cd tests/fixtures/minimal/
    ddc-services up -d  # Start mysql, mongodb, rabbitmq and admin tools
    derex reset-mailslurper  # Prime the mailslurper mysql database
    derex reset-mysql  # Prime the mysql database
    ddc-project up -d  # Start LMS/CMS daemons and workers
    derex compile-theme  # Compile theme sass files

Then head to one of the started services:

* http://localhost:4700 ``LMS``
* http://localhost:4800 ``CMS``
* http://localhost:5555 ``Flower`` (monitor celery workers)
* http://localhost:4300 ``Mailslurper`` (debug emails sent by the platform)
* http://localhost:4400 ``Adminer`` (mysql administration tool)
* http://localhost:9000 ``Portainer`` (docker administration tool)

You can login to the CMS and LMS using one of these users (the password is
always ``secret``):

* Username: ``user``, email ``user@example.com``
  Represents a student user.
* Username: ``staff``, email ``staff@example.com``
  Represents a member of the teaching staff.
* Username: ``superuser``, email ``superuser@example.com``
  Represents an administrator of Open edX. This user
  has full permissions inside the platform.
